# Suicide_Checkers

The "input.txt" and "Output.txt" files are just sample files used while doing a test run of the game
but with different conditions given by you as the player in a modified "input.txt", a new "output.txt" 
will be produced.

Remember to follow the instructions in "Checkers_Brief.pdf" file

You may need to recreate the class ".cpp" and ".h" files depending on the IDE you're using to compile the game. This
is not necessary if you're running the files via a linux-based command line.
